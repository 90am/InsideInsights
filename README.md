# InsideInsights

InsideInsights is a tool for managing insights during analysis. The system bridges cores aspects from literate computing, provenance tracking, and data-driven storytelling. In short, the system allows users to create interactive hierarchical data-driven reports during analysis, that at any point can be shared, reviewed, and extended. It was published as a research paper at the EuroVis conference in June 2019:
